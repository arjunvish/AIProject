To-Do:
- Pick a coordinator, recorder, and a checker. I propose to be the recorder (Arjun).
- Read the 3 papers and figure out 2 heuristics for the 8-puzzle problem.
- Implement Manhattan distance heuristics, and 2 heuristics from the literature.
- Create test cases.
- Run A* search on test cases.
- Fix goal configuration.
- Fix time limit for test cases.
- Find average value for each solution depth.
- Read about IDA* and SMA*.
- Choose a heuristic for 15-puzzle problem.
