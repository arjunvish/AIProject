	\section{Hypothesis}
		This is the report for the semester project for CS:4420 Artificial Intelligence. The project is divided into 2 parts. In the first part, we propose to compare the application of the A* search algorithm on the 8-puzzle problem using 3 different heuristics functions: Manhattan distance, misplaced tiles, and max-swap. We use the number of expanded nodes, the cost of the solution, the running time, and the effective branching factor as metrics for this comparison. In the second part, we implement the 15-puzzle problem using the IDA* search strategies for testing. \par
